# ktra-indexer

KTRA indexer is a simple Web application for listing and searching
artists and tracks from DJ Kutski's Keeping The Rave Alive (KTRA)
podcast. The application features episodes listing as well as both
track and artist search.

## Prerequisites

To run this application you will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or
above installed. Additionally, a PostgreSQL server instance
is needed. Database definitions can be found in `db-def.sql` and
a database with the required tables must exist before the application
can be started.

the to the `users` and `yubikeys` tables respectively. Some settings can be overridden
